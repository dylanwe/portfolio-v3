This project was a school assignment which I did in a group of five for a real company "[SmartShip](https://www.smart-ship.eu/)".

The SmartShip dashboard is a specialized tool for 
ship captains using SmartShip controls. It provides a centralized location for viewing and customizing relevant
ship data.

We created a customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to personalize their experience.
Our login feature uses JWT and refresh tokens for security and maintainability, with a sign-in page that accepts
email and password.

## Chosen project üéâ
We worked with scrum getting feedback from the customer we worked for. In the end we had a big presentation for
them showing everything we had. Out of the 6 groups for this customer we where the chosen project that they wanted to have.

## What we would do differently
- SpringBoot Security for security implementation
- Axios for handling fetch intercepts
- TypeScript for better type checking
- WebSockets for the notification and alert
- Using Next.js or Nuxt.js for faster page loading and an easier-to-understand structure.

## Reflection
The following feedback was given to me by my team.
- Heplful
- Did a lot of work
- Worked to quickly sometimes

I sometimes did a lot of work even in the vacations causing a lot of change and progess, this is good but
can be overwhelming. I really liked working with this team and it felt like we really tried making something cool.
