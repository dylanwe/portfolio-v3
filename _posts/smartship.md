This project was a school assignment that I worked on as part of a team of five for a real company, [SmartShip](https://www.smart-ship.eu/).

The SmartShip dashboard is a specialized tool designed for ship captains who use SmartShip controls. It serves as a centralized platform for viewing and customizing relevant ship data.

Our team developed a customizable dashboard with drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to personalize their experience. To ensure security and maintainability, we implemented a login feature using JWT and refresh tokens. The sign-in page accepts email and password for authentication.

## Winning project üéâ

Throughout the project, we followed the Scrum framework and actively sought feedback from the customer we were working for. In the end, we delivered a comprehensive presentation showcasing our progress. Among the six groups working on projects for this customer, our team's project was chosen as the preferred solution.

## Areas for Improvement

Reflecting on our project, there are several areas where we would make different choices if given the chance:

-   Implementing SpringBoot Security for enhanced security measures
-   Utilizing Axios to handle fetch intercepts effectively
-   Incorporating TypeScript for improved type checking
-   Integrating WebSockets for notifications and alerts
-   Considering the use of Next.js or Nuxt.js for faster page loading and a more intuitive project structure.

## Reflection

My team provided me with the following feedback:

-   Helpful
-   Contributed significantly to the workload
-   Occasionally worked too quickly

I acknowledge that I sometimes took on a substantial amount of work, even during vacations, which could be overwhelming. However, I thoroughly enjoyed collaborating with the team, and it felt rewarding to create something remarkable together.
